Inventory management is crucial for a rice wholesale trading house to maintain real-time inventory visibility, reduce costs, and respond to market changes. Aung Bi Win Rice Wholesale Trading House faces challenges in tracking, inefficiencies, and stock mismanagement, leading to an average annual inventory loss of 25%. This lack of visibility results in lost items or overselling items that do not exist in the warehouse.

The main goal of an Inventory Management System is to accurately record the quantity of all items in stock, along with their warehouse location and status. This will ensure operational efficiency, accuracy, and time savings. A well-managed inventory system can directly help prevent losses and keep supply-and-demand strategies on track.

The inventory management process can be broken down into five stages: employee management, purchasing, transferring, sales, and reporting. The key functionalities of this system include stock monitoring, purchase and sale management, automated updates, employee, customer, and supplier management, reporting and analytics, and delivery records management.

Implementing the Inventory Management System is expected to significantly reduce the annual inventory loss of 25% by eliminating the need for manual stock checks and improving workflow efficiency. The proposed project aligns fully with the trading house's goals to replace the current manual system with an accurate, reliable, and beneficial solution.

The proposed system scope includes the Rice Purchasing Process, Transferring Process, Sale Process, Delivering Process, and Reporting Process. The Rice Purchasing Process provides details of purchasing transactions and their important data records, facilitating easy invoice verification. The Transferring Process allows users to check transfer fees and labor fees, record transport quantities accurately, generate invoices, update stock levels, monitor delivery status, and generate reports on purchase and sale after analyzing database data. Key performance indicators for inventory accuracy and stock-out rates will be displayed on the dashboard for easy monitoring.
